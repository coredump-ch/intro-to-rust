\begin{frame}{Main Claims}
	\textbf{Performance}:\\Rust is \textbf{blazingly fast and memory-efficient}:
	with \textbf{no runtime or garbage collector}, it can power
	performance-critical services, run on embedded devices, and easily integrate
	with other languages.

	\pause

	\textbf{Reliability}:\\Rust's rich type system and ownership model guarantee
	\textbf{memory-safety and thread-safety} — and enable you to eliminate many
	classes of bugs \textbf{at compile-time}.

	\pause

	\textbf{Productivity}:\\Rust has great documentation, a friendly compiler with
	useful error messages, and top-notch tooling — an integrated package manager
	and build tool, smart multi-editor support with auto-completion and type
	inspections, an auto-formatter, and more.
